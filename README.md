# Python Phonebook Project

Welcome to the Python Phonebook Project! 
This repository is specifically designed as a hands-on assignment for students diving deep into Python. 
Through this project, students will have the opportunity to solidify their understanding by applying foundational concepts in a practical context. We delve into areas like file handling, 
data structures, and object-oriented programming, ensuring a comprehensive and enriching learning experience.


## Project Overview

This simple phonebook application enables users to:
- Add contact entries.
- Look up contacts by name.
- Delete existing contacts.
- Display all saved contacts.

Technically, the project utilizes:
- JSON for data storage.
- Python's `json` module.
- Object-oriented programming principles.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Understand JSON as a data interchange format.
- Learn file operations in Python.
- Explore Python dictionaries.
- Grasp basic OOP concepts: classes, methods, and objects.
- Engage in user interaction via input prompts and menu interfaces.
