# Phonebook Application

### By Aman Arabzadeh

This application serves as a hands-on experiment to understand and work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in Python. By creating a phonebook application, the goal was to delve deeper into the nuances of handling JSON data, such as reading, writing, and managing structured data.

Technically, the project utilizes:
- JSON for data storage.
- Python's `json` module.
- Object-oriented programming principles.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Understand JSON as a data interchange format.
- Learn file operations in Python.
- Explore Python dictionaries.
- Grasp basic OOP concepts: classes, methods, and objects.
- Engage in user interaction via input prompts and menu interfaces.
