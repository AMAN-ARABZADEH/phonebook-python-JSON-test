# Phonebook Application

### By Aman Arabzadeh

This application serves as a hands-on experiment to understand and work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in Python. By creating a phonebook application, the goal was to delve deeper into the nuances of handling JSON data, such as reading, writing, and managing structured data.

### Why Use JSON for this Experiment?

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is both human-readable and machine-friendly. For this experiment, JSON was chosen for several reasons:

- **Simplicity**: JSON's straightforward structure made it an excellent choice for getting hands-on quickly without a steep learning curve.
- **Practical Application**: With the widespread use of JSON in modern applications, experimenting with it provides practical knowledge that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
- **Integrated Support in Python**: Pythonâ€™s built-in `json` library makes it seamless to work with JSON data, thereby making the learning process smoother.
- **Flexibility**: JSON's ability to represent complex nested structures allows for more in-depth experimentation as one's understanding progresses.
- **Persistence**: For an application like a phonebook, persistently saving entries is crucial. JSON, with its textual format, made it possible to save, retrieve, and manipulate phonebook entries between sessions.

The phonebook application acts as a playground to explore these features and understand the practical implications of working with JSON.

## Project Overview

This simple phonebook application enables users to:
- Add contact entries.
- Look up contacts by name.
- Delete existing contacts.
- Display all saved contacts.

Technically, the project utilizes:
- JSON for data storage.
- Python's `json` module.
- Object-oriented programming principles.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Understand JSON as a data interchange format.
- Learn file operations in Python.
- Explore Python dictionaries.
- Grasp basic OOP concepts: classes, methods, and objects.
- Engage in user interaction via input prompts and menu interfaces.
